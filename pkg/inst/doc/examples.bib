  abstract = {We propose an automatic Bayesian approach to the selection of covariates
	and their penalised splines transformations in generalised additive
	models. Specification of a default, hyper-g prior for the model parameters
	and a multiplicity-correction prior for the models themselves is
	crucial for this task. We introduce the methodology in the normal
	model and extend it to non-normal exponential families. Two applications
	from the literature illustrate the proposed approach. An efficient
	implementation is available in an R-package.},
